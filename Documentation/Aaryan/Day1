Focus: Understanding the Basics Behind Blockchain Infrastructure

On Day 1, I focused on understanding the absolute fundamentals required to start working on blockchain systems and cross-chain research. Since I come from a non-computer background, the goal was not to build anything yet, but to understand how blockchain systems are accessed and why performance issues exist.

1.) Networking Basics (Conceptual Understanding)
What I Learned:

-Network latency is the delay between sending a request (like asking for data) and receiving a response.
-Round-Trip Time (RTT) measures how long it takes for a request to go from my machine to a server and back.
-Physical distance matters because blockchain nodes and servers are located in different geographic regions, and data must travel through physical network infrastructure.

**Why This Matters for My Research**

Cross-chain transactions depend on multiple networks and servers. Delays in communication can compound, increasing transaction time and cost.

2️.) RPC Nodes (First Exposure)
What I Learned:

-An RPC (Remote Procedure Call) node is how applications communicate with a blockchain.
-Wallets and decentralized applications do not talk to the blockchain directly — they send requests through RPC nodes.
-The quality of an RPC node (speed, reliability, location) affects:
  a) Transaction confirmation time
  b) Failure rates
  c) User experience

Practical Exposure

-I explored blockchain explorers such as Etherscan / Arbiscan.
-I learned that these explorers use RPC endpoints internally to read blockchain data.
-I discovered that most applications use fixed RPC endpoints, which can be inefficient under congestion.

**Why This Matters for My Research**

RPC latency and failures are a major hidden factor in cross-chain delays, yet they are often ignored in transaction optimization strategies.

3️.) Cloud Computing Basics (Conceptual)
What I Learned

-Blockchain infrastructure runs on cloud-hosted machines distributed across different regions.
-Cloud regions determine:
  a) Network latency
  b) RPC responsiveness
  c) Reliability of transaction submission
-Basic system metrics such as CPU usage and network usage indicate how stressed a machine or service is.

**Why This Matters for My Research**

Cross-chain systems rely on off-chain infrastructure (RPCs, relayers, servers). Cloud performance directly influences transaction success and latency.

4️.) First Hands-On Steps Toward Data Collection
What I Did

-Created accounts on blockchain explorers.
-Attempted to generate API keys for accessing on-chain data.
-Understood that datasets are not readily available for cross-chain performance and must be created manually.
-Realized that research in this domain requires instrumenting live systems, not downloading static datasets.

Key Realization

I am not “finding” a dataset —
I am building one by observing real-time blockchain behavior.

**Outcome of Day 1**

By the end of Day 1:

-I understood the basic building blocks behind blockchain infrastructure.
-I identified why network latency, RPC behavior, and cloud location are critical to cross-chain performance.
-I set the conceptual foundation needed to begin systematic data collection in the following days.
