For me, Day 1 is to learn basic networking and cloud concepts that are required to understand distributed systems and blockchain infrastructure.

Topics to Be Learned : 

1. Networking Basics

Concepts : 
A. What is network latency
B. What is round-trip time (RTT)
C. Why physical distance affects communication delay

Goal
To understand latency as a time delay in network communication.


2. RPC Nodes

Concepts:
A. What an RPC (Remote Procedure Call) node is
B. Why RPC nodes affect application and blockchain performance
C. Common reasons for RPC failure or timeout

Goal
To understand RPC nodes as the main entry point for interacting with a blockchain network.


3. Cloud Computing Basics

Concepts :
A. What a cloud region is
B. Basic idea of CPU usage
C. Basic idea of network usage

Goal
To understand cloud computing as distributed machines located in different geographic regions.
