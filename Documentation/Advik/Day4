Day 3
Saturday, Feb 14th, 2026 – 12:45 PM IST

Today I worked on building the on-chain data pipeline and storing Ethereum block data into MariaDB instead of CSV.
Initially, I was storing data in a CSV file. The problem I faced was that data was either getting overwritten or not persisting properly when the script was run multiple times. CSV is not reliable for continuous structured data collection.
So I decided to shift from CSV to MariaDB for proper storage and persistence.

What Data I Collected
From Ethereum blocks, I collected:

* Block number
* Timestamp
* Base fee per gas
* Gas used
* Gas limit
* Block fullness (gas_used / gas_limit)

This data helps measure congestion and fee behavior on the Ethereum network.
