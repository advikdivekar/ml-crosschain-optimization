Learning about the basic computer networks specifically about the network latency. 

Network latency or Delay id defined to be the time take for the entire message arrive at the destination from the time it is sent out from the source node. 

There are 4 components of Network Latency: 
a. Transmission Delay/Time - Message Size/Bandwidth 
b. Propagation Delay/Time - Distance/Propagation Speed 
c. Queueing Delay/Time - Based on the network Traffic, if high traffic then queueing time increases
d. Processing Delay/Time - time taken by the node to process the message

Also learnt about Bandwidth and Throughput.

Note : Throughput < Bandwidth
