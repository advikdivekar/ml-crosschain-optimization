Day 3 

Wednesday, Feb 11th, 2026 – 12:32 AM IST

Worked on collecting real on-chain data for the research project.

Objective:
To build the foundational dataset required for optimizing cross-chain cryptocurrency transfers.

Initially attempted to use blockchain explorer APIs but encountered deprecation issues. Switched to direct RPC communication with Ethereum using a node provider, which is a more reliable and infrastructure-level method.

Focused Data:

Collected from Ethereum blocks:

Block Number
Block Timestamp
Base Fee Per Gas
Base Fee Per Gas:
Under EIP-1559, the base fee is the minimum gas price required for a transaction to be included in a block. It dynamically changes based on network congestion.

What Data Was Needed and Why:

For cross-chain optimization, transaction cost depends heavily on gas prices.

If gas is high → transfer becomes expensive
If gas is low → transfer becomes cheaper

Therefore, understanding historical gas behavior is necessary for making cost-aware decisions.

How the Data Was Collected:

Created a virtual Python environment
Installed web3 library
Connected to Ethereum via RPC
Queried latest blocks
Extracted baseFeePerGas and timestamp
Stored data in CSV format
What This Data Indicates:
Base fee reflects demand for block space.

High base fee → high congestion
Low base fee → low congestion

It acts as an economic congestion signal for the blockchain.

Use of This Data:

This dataset will be used to:

Analyze gas volatility
Identify congestion patterns
Build predictive models for gas price behavior. 


Focused Data:

Collected from Ethereum mainnet:

a. Block Number
b. Block Timestamp
c. Base Fee Per Gas

Total Blocks Collected: 50
Storage Location: data/raw/eth_basefee.csv

Method:

a. Created isolated Python virtual environment
b. Installed required libraries
c. Connected directly to Ethereum via RPC provider
d. Queried latest block number
e. Fetched last 50 blocks
f. Extracted baseFeePerGas and timestamp
g. Stored data in structured CSV format

Purpose of This Data:

Under EIP-1559, Base Fee Per Gas represents the minimum cost required to include a transaction in a block. It dynamically adjusts based on network congestion.
This dataset captures the economic state of the Ethereum network over time.


Relevance to Research:
Since cross-chain transaction cost depends heavily on gas prices, understanding base fee behavior is essential for:
Cost estimation
Congestion awareness
Timing optimization
This step establishes the initial economic baseline of the Ethereum chain.


Next Step:
Increase dataset size and begin analyzing gas behavior patterns.
