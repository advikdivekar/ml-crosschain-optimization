Worked on collecting real on-chain data for the research project.
Objective:
To build the foundational dataset required for optimizing cross-chain cryptocurrency transfers.

Initially attempted to use blockchain explorer APIs but encountered deprecation issues. Switched to direct RPC communication with Ethereum using a node provider, which is a more reliable and infrastructure-level method.

Focused Data:

Collected from Ethereum blocks:

Block Number
Block Timestamp
Base Fee Per Gas
Base Fee Per Gas:
Under EIP-1559, the base fee is the minimum gas price required for a transaction to be included in a block. It dynamically changes based on network congestion.

What Data Was Needed and Why:

For cross-chain optimization, transaction cost depends heavily on gas prices.

If gas is high → transfer becomes expensive
If gas is low → transfer becomes cheaper

Therefore, understanding historical gas behavior is necessary for making cost-aware decisions.

How the Data Was Collected:

Created a virtual Python environment
Installed web3 library
Connected to Ethereum via RPC
Queried latest blocks
Extracted baseFeePerGas and timestamp
Stored data in CSV format
What This Data Indicates:
Base fee reflects demand for block space.

High base fee → high congestion
Low base fee → low congestion

It acts as an economic congestion signal for the blockchain.

Use of This Data:

This dataset will be used to:

Analyze gas volatility
Identify congestion patterns
Build predictive models for gas price behavior
Ultimately, this helps determine optimal timing for cross-chain transfers.
Conclusion of Day:

Successfully moved from theoretical networking concepts to real blockchain data acquisition. Established the first economic signal layer for the research system.
