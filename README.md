Machine Learning–Driven Optimization of Cross-Chain Cryptocurrency Transfers

Overview:

This project studies how cross-chain cryptocurrency transfers can be made more efficient by using data-driven optimization techniques. Cross-chain transfers often suffer from high transaction fees, unpredictable confirmation delays, and occasional failures due to changing blockchain congestion, network latency, and infrastructure performance.
The goal of this project is to observe and analyze blockchain transactions, network behavior, and cloud infrastructure metrics, and to use this information to improve how and when cross-chain transactions are submitted. By predicting near-term transaction conditions and selecting better submission strategies, the project aims to reduce transaction cost, delay, and failure rates.

Problem Statement:

Current blockchain wallets and decentralized applications typically submit transactions immediately using predefined RPC endpoints, without considering real-time network conditions or infrastructure performance. This static approach often leads to inefficient execution, especially in cross-chain transactions where delays and costs from multiple blockchains accumulate.
This project addresses the lack of adaptive, data-driven mechanisms for optimizing cross-chain cryptocurrency transfers by jointly considering blockchain state, network performance, and cloud infrastructure behavior.

Project Objectives:

Analyze blockchain transaction behavior in cross-chain transfers
Study the impact of network latency and RPC performance on transaction delay
Predict short-term transaction fees and confirmation times
Optimize transaction submission strategies to reduce cost and latency
Compare optimized strategies with traditional immediate-submission approaches

Methodology:
The project follows these main steps:

Data Collection:

Collect blockchain transaction data such as gas fees, timestamps, and confirmation times
Measure cross-chain transfer durations across source and destination blockchains
Monitor RPC response time, latency, and failure rates
Log basic cloud infrastructure metrics such as CPU and network usage

Data Analysis:

Study relationships between gas fees, congestion, and transaction delay
Analyze the effect of network and RPC performance on execution time
Identify patterns that lead to inefficient transfers

Prediction:

Build models to predict short-term transaction fees and confirmation times
Use historical data to estimate near-future transaction conditions

Optimization:

Design strategies to select suitable transaction submission times
Choose appropriate RPC endpoints and cloud deployment regions
Compare optimized execution against immediate submission

Evaluation:

Measure transaction cost, end-to-end delay, and success rate
Present results using comparative tables and plots
Expected Outcomes
Reduced transaction fees for cross-chain transfers
Lower confirmation and execution delays
Improved transaction reliability
Better understanding of how infrastructure performance affects blockchain transactions
